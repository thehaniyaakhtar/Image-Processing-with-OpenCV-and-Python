# Image-Processing-with-OpenCV-and-Python
This project explores basic image processing techniques using OpenCV and Python, applied to a dataset of cat and dog images. It is intended as a practical introduction to working with images in Python using common libraries and techniques.
Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your notebook titled **"Image Processing with OpenCV and Python"**, assuming it's an educational or beginner-friendly project exploring computer vision with a Cats vs Dogs dataset.

### Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of cat and dog images, organized as follows:

```
/kaggle/input/dogs-cats-images/dataset/
│
├── training_set/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
└── test_set/
    ├── cats/
    └── dogs/
```

### Tools & Libraries

- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- glob (for file path matching)

---

### Features Demonstrated

- Reading and displaying images using OpenCV
- Image resizing and color conversion (RGB, Grayscale)
- Basic transformations 
- Using `glob` to batch-load images
